# apbdp

Discord Presence for APB Reloaded by parsing the active log file (Current.log) the game creates.

## Usage

Download or compile `apbdp.exe` and place it in the game folder (where you can see folders like APBGame/ Binaries/ Engine/ etc.).

Run `apbdp.exe` as admin (apb requires admin rights), wait for the game to launch and look at your fancy presence on Discord.

Start parameters are passed through, so just append them; for example: `apbdp.exe -nomoviestartup`


*This program does not inject into the game or alter any files, so it should be safe to use. Still handle with care and know that you are responsible for your own actions.*
